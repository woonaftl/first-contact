    <textList>
      <text>While Pavonians themselves do not concern themselves with galactic war, their worlds are still far from peaceful. A pirate ship terrorizing civilians in this system, decided to make a move against you.</text>
      <text>The Pavonian space can be dangerous as pirates are allowed to roam and loot ships with impunity. One of those pirates is moving towards you with weapons armed.</text>
      <text>A pirate attacks you but the Pavonian cruisers nearby don't bat an eye. You can't tell for sure if they're in it together with pirates or just don't care.</text>

  <event name="PAVONIAN_REBEL_FIGHT" unique="true">
    <text>A Rebel ship is stationed at the beacon. "We are bringing order into this system. All incoming ships are to be inspected. Those who oppose, are to be destroyed." There is no way around a fight.</text>

  <event name="PAVONIAN_MANTIS_FIGHT" unique="true">
    <text>Mantis warships are comparatively rare in Pavonian space since Pavonians do not survive for long as slaves. Mantis prefer to kill Pavonians, and take their colorful plumage as loot. One of these humter ships is attacking you.</text>

      <text>You arrive in the middle of an ion storm. Slugs generally avoid these storms but you find one waiting in ambush. Prepare for a fight!</text>
      <text>You find yourself stuck in the middle of an ion storm with a Slug ship just a short distance away, refusing all hails. You cautiously try to slip further into the clouds, but they turn suddenly to attack!</text>

    <text>This beacon has been placed too close to a super-giant class M star! The ship will gradually overheat until you get out of here... or die. A pirate, apparently oblivious to the danger of the sun, moves in to engage.</text>

      <text>Sensors go wild as a nearby pulsar is detected. While you are attempting to recalibrate the FTL drive, a pirate sneaks up on your ship, weapons charging. Prepare for a fight!</text>
      <text>You arrive to find a pulsar dominating the view screen. You see a small silhouette pass in front of the star. Before you can ponder what it is, warning signals go off. It appears to be a ship in a firing trajectory!</text>
      <text>A small research station orbits a nearby pulsar. It appears largely abandoned, but you detect power signatures flaring up as soon as you're in scanning distance. A small combat ship launches from the station. Pirates!</text>

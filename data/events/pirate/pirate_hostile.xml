      <text>As you jump into the system a pirate advances on your position. They are refusing all hails. Prepare for a fight.</text>
      <text>Soon after arriving in the system you are hailed by a small cruiser. "What good fortune that we happen to run into each other. Nothing personal, but you have some information we need!"</text>
      <text>The only other ship at this beacon messages you: "Finally, after months of waiting, someone has fallen into our trap!"</text>
      <text>You barely have time to register jump completion before your ship warns you of an incoming ship with weapons hot.</text>

      <text>You arrive at the beacon and immediately detect a pirate ship. It seems this distress beacon was a trap!</text>
      <text>"Haha! I knew someone would fall into our dastardly trap!" It appears this distress beacon was nothing but a decoy for a pirate ambush.</text>
      <text>Your cockpit lights up with warning signals. You are being targeted by a nearby ship. The distress call was a lure to attract unwitting ships into weapons range. You prepare for a fight.</text>
      <text>As soon as you arrive at the distress signal, shots are fired toward your ship. A trap!</text>

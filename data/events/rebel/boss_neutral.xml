      <text>Shots fly by your port windows followed by a Rebel scout in pursuit of a damaged cruiser. Should we move in to engage?</text>
      <text>There seems to be a small Federation colony under attack by a Rebel forward scout. Will you protect them?</text>
      <text>A number of large transports are being pursued by a Rebel bombing squadron. One bomber has managed to slip through the defensive fire, and is poised to wreak havoc among the enormous yet vulnerable transports. There's time for you to advance and take it out!</text>
      <text>A battle rages nearby between small fighters; apparently fighting over a space station. The Federation appears to be losing ships fast. Shall we assist them?</text>

      <text>You arrive to see a number of Federation forward-carriers and dreadnoughts. This must be a system of high importance to warrant such a fleet.</text> <!-- large fed fleet-->
      <text>There are a few Federation fleets in the nearby area as well as a lot of wreckage. There must have been minor skirmishes in the area.</text> <!-- small fed fleet - debris-->
      <text>A few scattered heavy vessels are left to defend the nearby Federation settlement. They seem to be in the process of evacuation.</text> <!-- small fed fleet - populated planet-->
      <text>A large host of Federation heavy vessels are in formation around the beacon. Sensors run hot with missile locks, but once you transmit your ship signature they leave you alone.</text> <!--large fed fleet-->
      <text>A battalion of Federation fighters are fighting around a nearby moon with their carriers waiting in the distance. They must have encountered a Rebel scout squadron.</text><!-- small fed fleet - planet-->

      <text>Sensors indicate evidence of a huge battle nearby, but the immediate vicinity seems quiet. You try to lay low and keep out of the fighting.</text>
      <text>You arrive to find two fleets crashing against each other. Sensors are tracking the extent of the carnage. You quietly wait for the FTL drive to charge, knowing that the only way you can help is by completing your mission.</text>
      <text>A battle rages in the distance. Sensors suggest the presence of many vulnerable escape pods, but you know you cannot stop to help. The mission is paramount.</text>
      <text>A battle rages on in the distance. As much as you would like to help in the fight, you know the importance of your mission.</text>
      <text>You don't need advanced Sensors to tell there is a battle going on. You look out of the window quietly, waiting to jump. There's no way you can help in this fight.</text>
      <text>Two fleets are volleying shots at each other. Luckily no one seems interested in your ship. You prepare to make another jump.</text>

      <text>You arrive in the middle of a raging battle. Both sides are taking heavy losses. A small squadron flies past and a fighter breaks off, moving toward your position.</text>
      <text>Two fleets fight nearby. You try to skirt around the edges of the battle and keep out of weapons range, but a Rebel scout spots you and moves in.</text>
      <text>It's hard to tell who is winning the nearby battle. Before you have a chance to figure it out, a fighter moves in to attack.</text>
      <text>The sheer scale of the destruction in the distance is almost breath-taking. Unfortunately, your position as an independent observer doesn't last for long!</text>
      <text>The destruction in the distance is almost awe-inspiring. However you're dragged back to reality as Sensors indicate you are under attack.</text>
      <text>You don't have any time to worry about the battle in the distance. The fight is coming to you really quickly!</text>

      <text>Although you were expecting the Rebels, you never imagined their fleet could have grown so fast. You scanners can hardly register them all before a fighter stationed nearby moves in to attack.</text>
      <text>This system is flooded with Rebel warships. Luckily your ship's signature is disguised as a civilian transport. Most heavy vessels ignore you but a small fighter is approaching with weapons hot!</text> <!-- no environment?-->
      <text planet="PLANET_POPULATED">You arrive to find a Rebel battalion encircling a nearby planet, launching landing parties. A small scout moves toward your position. Prepare for a fight!</text>
      <text>As soon as you arrive you find yourself in the debris of a fierce battle. However, only Rebel warships remain and you find yourself immediately under attack.</text>
      <text>Shots fly by and your computer registers multiple weapon locks as soon as you arrive. Evasive action!</text>
      <text planet="PLANET_POPULATED">What was once a great series of space stations is now nothing but a small ring of debris around the nearby moon. There's no time to mourn the dead; an enemy approaches!</text>
      <text>The Federation seems to have put up a good fight. A number of Rebel ships lie broken or wounded. However their overwhelming numbers force the remaining Federation forces to retreat. Hopefully you can get away in time as well.</text>

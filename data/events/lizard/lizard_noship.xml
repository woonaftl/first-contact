      <text>The beacon is empty, if you don't count debris of several Lizard transports. Looks like the Rebellion has reached even the Lizard colonies, and left nothing but devastation behind. You collect resources from debris.</text>
      <text>The leader of a small fleet, a tiny remnant of the Lizard navy, greets you: "We're fighting the Rebels, same as you." They offer some supplies.</text>
      <text>You encounter some Federation loyalists hiding deep inside Lizard space: "The Lizards can be hostile sometimes, but it's nothing compared to Rebels." They share some resources.</text>

  <event name="LIZARD_FREE_WEAPON" unique="true">
    <text>A Lizard ship is stationed at the beacon, waiting for their FTL to charge: "The Rebels stand no chance. One strong blow, and the Rebellion will fall apart." The Lizards transfer a weapon to you, hoping that you will deal that blow.</text>

    <text>A small Lizard station is offering repairs using technology you have never seen before. It seems that the hulls are being patched up here using some sort of rare mold.</text>

      <text>Repair 5 hull for 5 scrap.</text>
      <event>
        <text>Your ship is sprayed with mold from a giant cannon. Most of it gets stuck to hull and begins to fill the scratches and breaches. After repairs are done, a small colony of mold is left on your ship's exterior. Lizard say that it can use scrap metal to repair ship's hull and is not killed by exposure to radiation or FTL travel.</text>

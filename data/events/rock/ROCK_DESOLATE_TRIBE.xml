          <text>You arrive to a planet to find a desolate Rock tribe. They have never seen aliens before, and are being very aggressive towards you.</text>

                <text>You manage to fend off the attacking Rocks and make a way back to your ship. Everyone is alive and well, but you could not obtain anything of value from the planet.</text>
              </event>
              <event>
                <text>The fight goes badly. The Rocks are using catapults to launch each other at your party. One of them falls right on a member of your crew and pins them down. You did not have any other choice but to leave the planet without them.</text>

          <text>As the small shuttle lands on the planet, a Rock tribe has gathered to greet you. They offer a meager amount of supplies as a welcoming gift.</text>

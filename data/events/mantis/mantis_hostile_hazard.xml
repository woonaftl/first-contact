  <event name="MANTIS_ASTEROID_FIGHT">
    <textList>
      <text>A Mantis fighter engages you in an asteroid field, their pilot skillfully dodging all obstacles. Time to test your own ship and crew.</text>
      <text>The asteroid fields attract the most reckless of Mantis, who depend on luck for hunting and usually don't survive for long. One of these hunters attacks you.</text>
      <text>While the asteroids could be devastating for Mantis ships, this particular fighter doesn't seem to care and attacks anyway.</text>

  <event name="MANTIS_SUN_FIGHT">
    <textList>
      <text>Who knows why the Mantis would venture so close to a sun. Perhaps it makes for more of a challenge?</text>
      <text>Everyone knows that the Mantis aren't particularly good at dealing with fires. Except the ship that attacks you dangerously close to a supergiant.</text>
      <text>This Mantis ship is either very bold or very stupid: they attack you near a sun, being exposed to its heat as much as you do.</text>

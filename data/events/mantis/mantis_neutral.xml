      <text>You're greeted by a rare sight: a Mantis ship that appears not to have noticed you.</text>
      <text>For once, you see the Mantis before they see you.</text>
      <text>When they see the Mantis warship waiting in ambush at your intended coordinates, your crew is relieved to note you've jumped someway off the mark.</text>
      <text>You overhear Mantis comm chatter: "Negative, I have killed more humans!" You gulp noticeably, but luckily they don't see you yet.</text>
      <text>You overhear Mantis comm chatter: "The one on the right is starting to rot. Take him down. Take off his fingers. Put him out of the airlock." They certainly don't seem to be friendly...</text>
      <text>You overhear Mantis comm chatter: "Agreed. Next ship is your turn. Good hunting." They don't see you yet.</text>

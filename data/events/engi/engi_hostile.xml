      <text>A mixed radar signal turns out to be a Mantis attack ship scavenging the remains of an Engi carrier. They turn and fight.</text>
      <text>You come across a Mantis raider taking pot shots at a defenceless Engi supply station. Discovering its weapons aren't much of a match for the station's armour, it turns on your ship. Battle stations!</text>
      <text>The area looks clear, and you prepare to jump off, but a Mantis scout jumps in behind you! They're as surprised as you are, but their weapons are already online.</text>
      <text>You find a Mantis ship harrying a small squad of Engi. They make it to the node and jump off, leaving you toe to toe with their pursuer!</text>

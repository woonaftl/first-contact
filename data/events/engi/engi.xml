      <text>The Engi can do remarkable things with just a pile of scrap. The Engi hive at this beacon are selling equipment for just that.</text>
      <text>A message arrives: "Your scrap, ours. Our weapons for you." You're about to raise the shields when you realize it's just an Engi trader looking for a trade.</text>
      <text>An Engi ship hails: "Engine upgrade necessary for travel home. Sale of equipment necessary for engine upgrade."</text>

      <text>You have arrived near an Engi construction yard. Most Engi maintain their bi-pedal appearance out of habit but here you see a number of Engi hives working together to create massive organic machines adept at building ships. Truly a sight to behold.</text>
      <text>You see a number of Engi space stations and fleets nearby. Despite looking like piles of junk loosely tied together they are actually a model of efficiency. They just lack a certain aesthetic emphasis in their constructions.</text>
      <text>This system appears quite peaceful. You're not sure how long it'll last between the combined threats of the Rebels and Mantis.</text>
      <text>You see a small Rebel carrier in the distance. You lay low and try to blend in with the other traffic. However it's surprising to see a Rebel military ship alone deep in Engi space.</text>
      <text>A cluster of Engi satellites in orbit of a nearby planet are the only clue the mechanical species was ever here. You have other places to be.</text>

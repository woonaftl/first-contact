              <text>You hold them off while retreating into the Med-bay. Its advanced systems determine that an alien neurotoxin is driving your crewmember insane. It synthesizes an antidote and releases it into the ship. After a time, the frenzied scientists recover and one offers to help out as thanks for saving them.</text>

          <text>You send your Anti-Personnel drone to explore the station. What you find is disconcerting... It appears that something has caused the scientists and guards to tear each other to pieces. You abandon the drone on the station for fear that it is contagious.</text>

          <text>Once on board the station, your drone is immediately beset by frenzied scientists and guards. It eventually gets torn apart by the mob but it has bought you enough time to disengage from the station and escape into empty space.</text>

          <text>There are no life signs detected on the ship although there appears to be a number of deceased crew. There does not appear to be any airborn contagions so your crew quickly salvages what they can before moving on. You can only wonder what befell the station.</text>

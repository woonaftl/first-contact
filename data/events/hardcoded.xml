  <textList name="TIPS_LIST">
    <text>TIP: Death - Remember, losing is part of the fun! ... No, I'm serious...</text>
    <text>TIP: Grinding Sectors - It can be beneficial to stay in a Sector for as long as possible to improve the ship since each Sector is increasingly difficult.</text>
    <text>TIP: Exits - It's tempting to rush for the Sector exits, but exploring is the only way to upgrade your ship. Try and get as much out of each Sector as possible.</text>
    <text>TIP: Targets - Prioritize your targeting in combat. Weapons and Shields are usually the best choice, but if they're fleeing, hit their Engines or Piloting to prevent escape.</text>
    <text>TIP: Hidden Choices - When you see a blue colored choice in an event, it's a special option that has been made available by your current equipment.</text>
    <text>TIP: System Damage - When a System fully breaks due to fire or boarders, the hull also takes one damage.</text>
    <text>TIP: Power Bars - Upgraded Systems can be helpful even if you don't have enough reactor power to use them; they still absorb one damage.</text>
    <text>TIP: Weapons - You can queue up an attack before the weapon is charged. It will fire when it's charged.</text>
    <text>TIP: Cloaking - Cloaking prevents enemies from firing on your ship or charging their weapons. It also increases your base evasion by 60.</text>
    <text>TIP: Boarding - If you're having trouble with boarders, fight within the medbay. If all else fails, vent the rest of the oxygen out of the ship!</text>
    <text>TIP: Oxygen - If the ship's room color changes from tan to red, it means you're losing oxygen. Crew will be damaged and fires will burn out in rooms with red hazard stripes.</text>
    <text>TIP: Shield Piercing - Missiles ignore shields. Use missiles to damage a powerful ship's Shields System. Just remember that Defense Drones can shoot down missiles!</text>
    <text>TIP: Choices - Results of most choices have multiple outcomes. You can never be sure what will happen.</text>
    <text>TIP: Autofire - Autofire will let a weapon maintain its target. Just keep an eye on your missile count!</text>
    <text>TIP: Evasion - Evading enemy shots is crucial, but it requires functioning engines AND a pilot. Having someone man the engines will increase your evasion as well.</text>
    <text>TIP: Sensors - If the ship goes dark, don't panic. Just fix the Sensors Subsystem.</text>
    <text>TIP: Drones - If you're struggling against enemy Drones, target the Drone System to temporarily disable them.</text>
    <text>TIP: Beams - Beam weapons do damage based on the number of rooms they hit. Each Shield bubble will block 1 damage of a beam; it's best to use beams when the enemy's shields are down.</text>
    <text>TIP: Fire - If fire is spreading, consider opening airlocks and doors to vent the oxygen from parts of your ship. Fire is quickly extinguished without O2.</text>
    <text>TIP: Health - Pay attention to your crew's health! Use the Medbay to keep them patched up.</text>
    <text>TIP: Upgrades - Don't forget to upgrade your ship! Often shields are the highest priority, but don't underestimate the usefulness of subsystems.</text>
    <text>TIP: Fuel - Every jump consumes one unit of fuel, so keep an eye on your reserves. Buy fuel at stores to avoid being left stranded.</text>
    <text>TIP: Sound - Go into the options menu to turn on or off the sound effects and music.</text>
    <text>TIP: Asteroids - Fighting in asteroid fields is dangerous, but use it to your advantage. Take out enemy Shields and let the rocks take care of the rest.</text>
    <text>TIP: Nebula - Passing through a Nebula will allow you to temporarily slow down the fleet advancement but they contain their own unique dangers.</text>
    <text>TIP: Solar Flares - Solar flares will cause hull damage in addition to starting fires. Make sure your shields are up to help mitigate this effect.</text>
    <text>TIP: Score - Your score is based on how many ships you defeat, the number of beacons explored, and your total scrap collection.</text>
    <text>TIP: Augmentations - Your ship can only hold 3 augmentations. They provide unique benefits to a system, the crew or the entire ship.</text>
    <text>TIP: Breaches - If a room with a breach has no Oxygen, try opening all the doors surrounding it to make it less hazardous.</text>
    <text>TIP: Rebel Fleet - The Rebel fleet (represented by the red circle on the map) moves closer to your position every time you jump. Certain events can slow or speed up their movement.</text>
    <text>TIP: Ion Weapons - Ion weapons de-power and lock a System for a time. If they hit the enemy shields they deal their stun damage directly to the Shields System.</text>
    <text>TIP: Bomb Weapons - Bombs teleport directly onto either ship. They bypass Shields AND Defense Drones. However, they affect only crew and Systems; they do no damage to the ship's hull.</text>
    <text>TIP: Door Subsystem - Upgrading your doors will greatly reduce the chance of fire spreading between rooms and will significantly slow boarder movement.</text>

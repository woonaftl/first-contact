    <text>Inside this nebula you detect a rogue planet drifting through space, on its surface a huge monolith visible at this distance even to the naked eye. A Zoltan elder hails you from the planet. "Through luck or intent, you have discovered the Great Eye. Look into its depths and receive your just deserts."</text>

          <text>As you approach, an ancient alien voice speaks to you: "Your mission has brought you great battles, and great losses. This will help ease the pain." A few minutes later someone reports medical equipment has appeared on the ship!</text>

          <text>You approach the planet and wait, but nothing happens. The Zoltan hail: "And in the coming times, when the monolith speaks not with a man he has no future and must be left wanting."</text>

          <text>You approach the planet carefully, trying to keep your ship from breaking up in orbit. The monolith, whatever it is, must sense as much because the next thing you know you have enough scrap to patch up your damage and more besides!</text>

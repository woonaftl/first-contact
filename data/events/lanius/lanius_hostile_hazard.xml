  <event name="LANIUS_FIGHT_PULSAR" unique="true">
    <text>There appears to be some sort of research station near a pulsar, although it's hard to tell since a portion of it has been melted. The Lanius ship that has been working at it moves in to intercept you, totally oblivious to the threat of EM pulses.</text>

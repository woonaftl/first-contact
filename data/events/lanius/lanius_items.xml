    <text>You stumble across a badly damaged Lanius craft. It jumps away as soon as it sees you. Looking around the area, you discover a number of destroyed Rebel automated ships. It must have been quite the fight. You scrap what remains.</text>

    <text>A Federation science craft is docked with a few Lanius ships. You hail them and ask what is going on. "Greetings! We have been attempting to understand our region's newest visitors, the Lanius, although we have been making little headway in deciphering their language."</text>

      <text>Ask if they have anything that could help your mission.</text>

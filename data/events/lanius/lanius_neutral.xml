      <text>You immediately receive a message upon arrival, "Help! These metal bastards have gone crazy!" The communication originates from the hull of a partially dismantled ship which lies among a number of other destroyed ships. The violent Lanius ship responsible for this carnage is advancing on the survivors.</text>
      <text>You scan the area after arriving at this system. A Lanius ship is in fast pursuit of an unarmed civilian ship. It's hard to say if it's truly a threat since its weapons are not charging.</text>
      <text>You arrive at the location of a recent battle. Judging from the debris, some settlers attempted to fight off a number of small Lanius ships, although it's impossible to say who instigated the aggression. A few skirmishes can be seen in the distance, but more notably a lone Lanius ship is firing on a heavily damaged civilian vessel.</text>
